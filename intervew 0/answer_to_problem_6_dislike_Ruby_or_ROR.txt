What do you dislike the most about Ruby/RoR?

I love everything about Ruby. I think true to its mission, Ruby makes me happy. For me the perfect computer language is one that can be understood easily at a glance, even by a layperson. When I compare JavaScript to Ruby, JavaScript seems unnecessarily superfluous. 

Regarding Rails, as many like to talk about its lack of scaling, coupling of ActiveRecord to class objects, and even snobby community, the biggest concern I have is the amount of time it takes to run tests. There are preloaders but none that works well for Windows. (I've tried them all and asked on stackoverflow)
